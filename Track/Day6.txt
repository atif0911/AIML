So today i learnt about the things i already knew back from my last sem about stats like mean median mode quantile n all 
and i focused on its syntaxes cuz i knew about the concepts. So i have stored my content in Stats with an example puny data set and some operations on it. 

Now i brushed up the concepts of groupby and agg methods. N stored my content in GroupByAgg folder.
