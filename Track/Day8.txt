Today i finished my intro to MatplotLib and did a project for visualise a Netflix Dataset stored in MatPlotLib/project.

Now i took a introduction to seaborns data visualisation. It is similar to matplotlib i guess. I got to know about iris inbuilt data set in seaborns hehehe

that is it so far.

I started doing a very interesting analysis on friends dataset. Which is stored in Friends folder. I am yet to finish this project. So far i enjoyed it.

That is it for today!
