NumPy is a kind of list and was introduced because the list were very slow. NumPy itself is very fast.
NumPy uses less bytes of memory.
No type checking when iterating through objects.
Uses Contiguous memory. whereas list are scattered around.
Contiguous memory helps in faster SIMD vector processing.
Effective cache utilization.
NumPy are list but BETTERRRR...
