In the last couple of days i started Machine Learning. Starting with the types of machine learning such as Supervised and Unsuperwised learning. Followed by More on Supervised learning like Classification and regression.
In Classification i learned about Logistic regression, Naive Bayes(probability), Kth Nearest Neighbour. In regression I learned about linear regression. 
I learned about Decision trees, Random forest also. 

Then i studied about Ensemble Learning which uses multiple models to train using Bagging, Boosting, Stacking.
I focused more on the theoretical part lately and Today i started a practical course on ML from freecodecamp.

HEHEHE this is fun so far...

That is it for today.
